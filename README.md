# FunPark (or: "Advanced Functional Programming with F#")

*FunPark* is a miniature theme park management system built, from scratch, in [Advanced Functional Programming with Elixir](https://pragprog.com/titles/jkelixir/advanced-functional-programming-with-elixir/) (by Joseph Koski).

As the title of the book implies, Koski uses [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) as his language of choice, and an excellent choide it is - Elixir is a premium Functional Programming language!  
And while I do admire Elixir, and enjoyed hobby-coding in it in the past, today my passion is with [F#](https://fsharp.org/).

It, therefore, made sense to me, seeing a book that builds a real-life-like project like this one, to see how easy it can be translated into F#, the two language being **very** different, only sharing being FP languages.

This repo is the journey by an F# admirer, but **by no case expert** into programming transliteration.  
I think it's quite appropriate to "oh boy!".

**Oh, boy!** ðŸ˜„

## P.S

If you like F#, but Elixir (and Erlang) are more your style, check out the [Gleam programming language](https://gleam.run/).

It's Elixir with, well, many goodies added, but the most important one, to me, is a **strong, static type system**, which I found Elixir lacking, bringing it on par with my beloved F#, [OCaml](https://ocaml.org/), and [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/).
