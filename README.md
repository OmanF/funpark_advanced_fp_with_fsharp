# FunPark (or: "Advanced Functional Programming with F#")

*FunPark* is a miniature theme park management system built from scratch in [Advanced Functional Programming with Elixir](https://pragprog.com/titles/jkelixir/advanced-functional-programming-with-elixir/) by Joseph Koski.

As the title of the book implies, Koski uses [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) as his language of choice, and an excellent choice it is - Elixir is a premium Functional Programming language!  
And while I do admire Elixir, and enjoyed hobby-coding in it in the past, today my passion is with [F#](https://fsharp.org/).

This repo is a challenge, and journey by an F# admirer, but **by no means an expert**, into seeing how easy reimplementing that system in F# could be.  
**Oh, boy!** ðŸ˜„

## P.S

If you like F#, but Elixir (and Erlang) are more your style, check out the [Gleam programming language](https://gleam.run/).

It's Elixir with, well, many goodies added, but the most important one, to me, is a **strong, static type system**, which I found Elixir lacking, bringing it on par with my beloved F#, [OCaml](https://ocaml.org/), and [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/).
